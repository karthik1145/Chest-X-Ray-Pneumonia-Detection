# Chest-X-Ray-Pneumonia-Detection\
Pneumonia is a disease that affects the lungs. This is caused by Bacteria or Virus that fills the Air Sacks with Fluid/pus making it difficult to breathe.\
Commonly affected are Infants, children and people over 65 years in age.\
In order to enhance the detection with the help of AI Applications, the X-Ray Images can be used to detect the disease by using Convolutional Neural Netwoks.
Pneumonia Detection is possible with the help of X-Ray Images by training a Convolutional Neural Network Model.\

# Dataset\
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). In this project, I have used the help of 'Kaggle API' in google colab to download this ImageDataGenerator to flow the data into train and test Sets.
