# Chest-X-Ray-Pneumonia-Detection
Pneumonia Detection by using X-ray images by using Convolutional Neural Networks
#Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause it. The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs, which are called alveoli. The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe. 
#By using concepts of Image Detection, we can classify an X-Ray image if patient is diagnosed with Pneumonia.
